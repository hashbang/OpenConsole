# OpenNosta
Open source hardware project for playing and preserving retro console games on modern systems

## Overview
OpenNosta is short for Open-Source Nostalgia (but also happens to mean "remarkable/famed" in [Irish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/n%C3%B3sta) or "lift/raise/elevate" in [Finnish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nostaa#Finnish)). Consider it an open-source implementation of the Retrode with a broader scope -- it provides a physical layer to classic game cartridges and controllers but can be extended and modified freely.
